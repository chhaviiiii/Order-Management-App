# ORDER TRACKER APPLICATION

## An efficient tracker for all your business order management needs

- This application will serve as an order tracking system for businesses. The key functionality includes adding new orders, updating the status of orders, and removing completed orders. 

Class X, referred to as **Order**, will contain detailed information about the orders, such as *order ID, product details, customer details, and the current status of the order*.

Class Y, referred to as **OrderTracker**, will maintain a *dynamic list of all active orders*. When an order is fulfilled or completed, the **OrderTracker** will remove it from the active list.


- The primary users of this application will be business owners and their employees who handle order management. It could also be beneficial for restaurant owners. This can include a broad range of businesses - from a small eCommerce store owner selling handmade goods, to a large restaurant chain managing numerous food orders. The application is general enough to suit the needs of any type of business that deals with orders.


- I find this project interesting as it aligns closely with my personal experiences and environment. My brother is a business owner and we currently live in an era where start-ups are prevalent.
Understanding the importance of effective order and task management systems in running a successful business, I see the potential impact this project could have in improving operational efficiencies.  Furthermore, the ability to create a solution that could be beneficial to a wide range of individuals, from students to entrepreneurs. The task-oriented nature of this project resonates with my organizational values, providing an opportunity to innovate in ways that could profoundly impact how people manage their time and workloads.
